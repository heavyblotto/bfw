# Next.js Game Project: Initial Design Document

## Project Overview
This document outlines the initial design and architecture decisions for a single-player, turn-based game developed using Next.js. The game will feature different characters, levels, and game mechanics, with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and performance.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Hosting/Deployment**: Vercel
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **State Management**: React Context API with Zustand 
- **Data Storage**: YAML and Markdown with front matter
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library

### Additional Tools and Libraries
- Linting: ESLint
- Formatting: Prettier
- API Routes: Next.js built-in API routes
- Image Optimization: Next.js Image component
- SEO: Next.js Head component and dynamic metadata

## Data Management
- Character data, level descriptions, and game mechanics stored in YAML files.
- Longer descriptions and narratives stored in Markdown files with YAML front matter.
- Data accessed and served through Next.js API routes.

## Routing and Navigation
- Page-based routing using Next.js file-system based routing.
- Dynamic routes for game levels and character pages.
- Programmatic navigation using Next.js `useRouter` hook.
- Link component from `next/link` for client-side navigation.

## State Management
- Zustand for global state management.
- React hooks for local component state.

## Authentication
- NextAuth.js for user authentication.
- Protected routes and API endpoints.

## Rendering Strategies
- Mix of Client-Side Rendering (CSR) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
- CSR for dynamic game components.
- SSR for initial game state and static content.

## API Design
- RESTful API endpoints using Next.js API routes.
- API routes for game state management, character data, level information.
- Authentication middleware for protected endpoints.
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Performance Optimization
- Code splitting using dynamic imports.
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component.
- Font optimization.
- Efficient loading of third-party scripts.

## Testing Strategy - to be implemented
- Jest for unit and integration testing.
- React Testing Library for component testing.
- Consider axe-core for accessibility testing.

## Deployment and CI/CD
- Vercel for hosting and automatic deployments.
- GitHub Actions for additional CI/CD processes (if needed).

## Security Considerations
- CSRF protection.
- Content Security Policy (CSP).
- Secure headers.
- API rate limiting.

## Future Considerations
- WebSocket support for real-time features.
- Database integration for persistent data storage.
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities.
- Internationalization (i18n) support.
- Advanced state management with Zustand.

This design document serves as a starting point and should be updated as the project evolves and new decisions are made.
