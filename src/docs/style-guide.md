# *Bigfoot War* Style Guide [DRAFT]

The game’s visual identity blends retro pixel art with immersive, natural elements, ensuring the player feels fully embedded in a world where Bigfoot-like creatures roam dense forests, misty swamps, and desolate mountain peaks.

Our UI and HUD design reflects these natural, earthy environments, using textures and colors that mimic wood, stone, moss, and dirt. The goal is to create an interface that is not only functional but also seamlessly integrated into the game's setting—every button, health bar, and ability icon should feel like it belongs in the wilds.

The aesthetic focuses on delivering a minimalistic but efficent user experience, where essential gameplay information is presented clearly but without disrupting immersion. Interactions with the UI should feel organic and in tune with the natural environments, emphasizing accessibility while maintaining an adventurous, raw, and mythic quality throughout.

This guide is designed to ensure that the look and feel of the game consistently reflects these core themes: a pixelated wilderness of cryptid creatures, ancient legends, and epic battles. Whether navigating menus, managing health bars, or exploring the HUD, players should always feel connected to the mythos of Bigfoot and the mysteries of the untamed world.

#### **1. Pixel Art Aesthetic Guidelines**

##### **1.1 Visual Consistency**
- **Resolution**: Maintain a consistent pixel density across all UI elements and HUD components. Aim for a low-resolution pixel art style that mirrors the game’s retro feel, with chunky, well-defined pixels.
- **Textures**: Use subtle pixelated textures for UI elements to create depth and a sense of environment. Think **wood**, **stone**, **fur**, and **leather** textures that match the rugged, outdoor theme.
  - **Health Bars**: Should resemble cracked stone or bark to maintain the natural aesthetic.
  - **Dialogue Boxes**: Mimic parchment, stone, or moss-covered surfaces.
- **Color Palette**: Stick to an earthy palette with low-saturation colors like muted greens, browns, and greys. Use high-contrast colors (red, orange, blue) for important actions or warnings.
  - **Primary Colors**: Green, brown, grey, moss, muted blue.
  - **Highlight Colors**: Red for health drops, orange for alerts, blue for special abilities.

##### **1.2 Iconography**
- **Icons**: Icons should be clean, well-defined, and match the pixel art style of the game world. Each icon must be recognizable at small sizes (e.g., inventory, health, ability icons).
  - **Health**: Icons could resemble a pixelated heart, leaf, or footprint.
  - **Status Effects**: Poison, stun, and other debuffs could use Bigfoot-related imagery (footprint, claw marks, etc.).
- **Animations**: Add light pixel animations to elements such as buttons, bars, and icons to give them a subtle “living” quality. Hover effects like glowing or slight bouncing animations can add liveliness without cluttering the screen.

##### **1.3 Animations & Feedback**
- **Hover Feedback**: When the player interacts with buttons or icons, use pixel-based feedback animations like color changes, pixel shakes, or subtle glows.
  - **Example**: Buttons could flash or pulse when hovered over, mimicking natural elements like fireflies or flickering campfire embers.
- **Damage Feedback**: Health and mana bars should animate smoothly, with pixelated draining effects that mimic the environment (e.g., “dripping” effect like water or falling debris).

#### **2. UI & HUD Guidelines**

##### **2.1 Layout & Structure**
- **Minimalistic Design**: Keep the HUD uncluttered, with key information accessible but non-intrusive. Players should have a clear view of the environment, while important elements (health, stamina, abilities) remain in peripheral vision.
  - **Health/Stamina**: Located in the top-left corner for easy visibility, designed as stone or wood bars that erode or crack with damage.
  - **Ability Icons**: Positioned along the bottom, with a worn, natural look (wooden tiles or stone slabs). Abilities are represented by bold, pixel icons that are distinct and easy to recognize at a glance.
  
##### **2.2 Dialogue Boxes**
- **Shape & Style**: Dialogue boxes should look like ancient scrolls, stone carvings, or worn-out maps. Ensure text is pixelated but easy to read, with color contrasts between text and background.
  - **Dialogue Position**: Keep the dialogue box at the bottom of the screen to avoid covering important gameplay areas.
  - **Text Style**: Use a simple pixel font that is easy to read. Text should be white or light grey against darker backgrounds for maximum readability.
  
##### **2.3 Inventory & Menus**
- **Design Theme**: The inventory and menus should resemble an adventurer’s journal or explorer’s satchel. Use rustic elements like wood, leather straps, and aged parchment for visual elements.
  - **Grid Layout**: Keep item grids simple and easy to navigate. Each item should have a detailed pixel art representation with clear outlines.
  - **Highlighting**: When hovering or selecting items, the grid should highlight with a pixelated glow or frame, using colors that fit the game’s palette (e.g., orange or blue).

##### **2.4 Notifications & Alerts**
- **Visual Feedback**: Alerts should blend into the game's aesthetic while grabbing attention when necessary. Use pixelated speech bubbles, pop-ups, or banners that emerge from the corners of the screen.
  - **Damage Alerts**: Use red pixelated pop-ups for damage taken. For buffs or heals, consider green or blue pop-ups that slide into view briefly.

#### **3. UX Guidelines**

##### **3.1 Player Clarity & Interaction**
- **Ease of Navigation**: Keep menus simple with clear navigation paths. Buttons should be large enough to easily interact with, even in their pixelated form, with clear labels and visible hover states.
- **Consistent UI Elements**: Each type of UI element (buttons, tabs, sliders) should follow the same pixel art design and style throughout the game to maintain player familiarity and flow.
- **Clear Feedback**: Ensure every player interaction with the UI (e.g., selecting a button, switching menus) is met with visual and audio feedback (e.g., pixel sounds, glowing buttons, or bounce effects).

##### **3.2 Immersion through UI**
- **Blended HUD Elements**: All HUD components should feel like they belong in the game world. Avoid modern, sleek elements, opting for natural-looking buttons and frames that feel like they are part of the environment.
  - **Example**: The pause menu could resemble a scroll unfurling or a weathered map pinned to the screen.

##### **3.3 Player-Centric Experience**
- **Non-Intrusive HUD**: The HUD should allow players to focus on the gameplay without being distracted by too much on-screen information. Information should be easy to locate, but not constantly demanding attention.
  - **Health & Mana/Ability Bars**: Make them fade slightly when not in immediate use to reduce clutter.
