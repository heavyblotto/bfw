# *Bigfoot War* Style Guide

The game's visual identity blends retro pixel art with immersive, natural elements, ensuring the player feels fully embedded in a world where Bigfoot-like creatures roam dense forests, misty swamps, and desolate mountain peaks.

Our UI and HUD design reflects these natural, earthy environments, using textures and colors that mimic wood, stone, moss, and dirt. The goal is to create an interface that is not only functional but also seamlessly integrated into the game's settingâ€”every button, health bar, and ability icon should feel like it belongs in the wilds.

The aesthetic focuses on delivering a minimalistic but efficient user experience, where essential gameplay information is presented clearly but without disrupting immersion. Interactions with the UI should feel organic and in tune with the natural environments, emphasizing accessibility while maintaining an adventurous, raw, and mythic quality throughout.
