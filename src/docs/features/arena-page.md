# Arena Page Design

### Arena - Main Game Page
Once they select a Match in, Players are taken to the **Arena** page, where they can begin the card game. The design includes:
- **Deck Area**: The deck of the Player’s Bigfoot and the AI Opponent’s Bigfoot.
- **Battlefield**: Where cards are played, showing the Player’s and Opponent’s cards during a round.
- **Controls**:
  - **Draw** button: Allows the Player to draw and play the next card.
  - **War Scenario (if tie)**: Trigger for the "War" phase.
  - **Attack/Collect Cards Option**: After winning a round, the winning Participant chooses between collecting the cards or attacking the Opponent.
  - **End Game**: When the game ends, the Player is taken to the **Results** page.

- **Purpose**: The Arena is the main game page, where the Player can play the game. The Arena theme is based on the Opponent's selected Bigfoot character.
- **User Journey**:
  1. The Player selects a Match and enters the Arena.
  2. The Player draws and plays cards, collecting cards and attacking the Opponent.
  3. The Player wins or loses the game, and is taken to the **Results** page.
