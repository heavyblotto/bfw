## Overview
The account management system allows users to register, sign in, update their account information, and delete their account. It uses NextAuth.js for authentication, Prisma ORM for database interactions, and Zustand for client-side state management.

## Data Models
- User model in Prisma schema (implemented)
- PlayerProfile model linked to User (implemented)

## API Routes
- /api/auth/[...nextauth]: NextAuth.js configuration (implemented)
- /api/auth/register: User registration (implemented)
- /api/auth/update: Update user information (implemented)
- /api/auth/delete: Delete user account (implemented)

## Components
- SignIn component (implemented)
- Register component (implemented)
- UpdateUserForm component (implemented)
- DeleteAccountButton component (implemented)

## Authentication Flow
1. User registration
2. User sign-in
3. Session management
4. Account updates
5. Account deletion

## State Management
- Zustand store for client-side authentication state (implemented)
- Real-time UI updates for email changes (implemented)

## Security Considerations
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt (implemented)
- Protected routes using Next.js middleware and NextAuth.js (implemented)
- HTTPS enforced in production
- CSRF protection via NextAuth.js

## Implementation Plan

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Set up NextAuth.js with Credentials provider
- ✅ Create User model in Prisma schema
- ✅ Implement user registration API route
- ✅ Implement user update API route
- ✅ Implement user deletion API route
- ✅ Create SignIn component
- ✅ Create Register component
- ✅ Create UpdateUserForm component
- ✅ Create DeleteAccountButton component
- ✅ Implement Zustand store for authentication state
- ✅ Integrate components with Main Menu page
- ✅ Implement real-time email update functionality

### Next Steps
1. Enhance error handling and validation in API routes
2. Implement password reset functionality
3. Add email verification for new accounts
4. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA)
5. Create comprehensive unit and integration tests for account-related components and API routes

### Future Enhancements
- Social media login integration
- Account linking (e.g., linking multiple login methods)
- Enhanced account security features (e.g., login history, device management)
