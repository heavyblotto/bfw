# Achievements System Design

## Overview
The Achievements system provides players with goals to strive for, rewards for their accomplishments, and a sense of progression beyond the main gameplay loop. Achievements are designed to encourage diverse gameplay styles and long-term engagement.

## Data Model

```prisma
model Achievement {
  id              Int           @id @default(autoincrement())
  name            String
  description     String
  type            String
  requirement     Int
  rewardGold      Int
  rewardXP        Int
  rewardPoints    Int
  playerProfileId Int
  playerProfile   PlayerProfile @relation(fields: [playerProfileId], references: [id])
  unlockedAt      DateTime?
}

## Implementation Plan

1. Create the Achievement model in the Prisma schema
2. Implement API routes for Achievement data:
   - GET /api/achievements/:playerProfileId: Retrieve achievements for a specific player
   - POST /api/achievements/unlock: Unlock an achievement for a player
3. Create an AchievementDisplay component to show player achievements
4. Implement logic to track achievement progress during gameplay
5. Create an achievement notification system
6. Integrate achievement rewards with the player's Gold, XP, and Points

## Components

- AchievementDisplay: Shows an overview of player achievements
- AchievementNotification: Displays a pop-up when an achievement is unlocked
- AchievementDetailView: Provides more information about a specific achievement

## API Routes

- GET /api/achievements/:playerProfileId: Retrieve achievements for a specific player
- POST /api/achievements/unlock: Unlock an achievement for a player

## State Management

- Store current player achievements in the Zustand store
- Update achievement progress in real-time during gameplay

## Rewards System

- Each achievement provides a combination of Gold, XP, and Points as rewards
- Special achievements may unlock exclusive cosmetic items or Bigfoot variants

## Next Steps

1. Design a diverse set of achievements covering various aspects of gameplay
2. Implement the Achievement model in the Prisma schema
3. Create migration for the updated schema
4. Develop API routes for retrieving and unlocking achievements
5. Create the AchievementDisplay, AchievementNotification, and AchievementDetailView components
6. Integrate achievement tracking into the game logic
7. Implement the achievement notification system
8. Design and implement achievement-specific rewards
9. Create an achievement progress tracking system for multi-step achievements

## Considerations

- Balance achievement difficulty to provide a sense of accomplishment without frustration
- Ensure achievements encourage diverse gameplay styles and strategies
- Consider adding "hidden" achievements for surprise elements
- Implement proper error handling for achievement updates and retrievals
- Plan for future scalability, such as adding new achievements for special events or new game features
- Consider adding an achievement points system for meta-progression

This Achievement system will provide players with additional goals and rewards, enhancing engagement and encouraging diverse gameplay experiences in Bigfoot War.
